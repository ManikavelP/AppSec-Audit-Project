# Vulnerability Report: SQL Injection (VULN-001)

- **Vulnerability Type:** SQL Injection (Authentication Bypass)
- **CWE Reference:** [CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html)
- **Severity:** **Critical**

---

### Description
The login functionality of the application is vulnerable to SQL Injection. The application code insecurely concatenates user-supplied input from the email field directly into a raw SQL query. By providing a malicious, specially crafted string, an attacker can manipulate the query's logic to bypass authentication entirely and gain unauthorized access to any user's account, including the administrator's.

### Proof of Concept (PoC)
1.  Navigate to the application's login page (`/login`).
2.  In the **Email** field, enter the payload: `' OR 1=1--`
3.  In the **Password** field, enter any value (e.g., `password`).
4.  Click the "Log in" button.
5.  **Result:** The user is successfully authenticated and redirected to the application as the administrator.

**(INSERT YOUR SCREENSHOT HERE showing you are logged in as the admin)**

### Business Impact
A successful exploit of this vulnerability would lead to a complete compromise of the application. An attacker could:
-   Steal sensitive personal data of all users.
-   Modify or delete application data.
-   Impersonate users, including administrators, to perform privileged actions.
-   Cause severe reputational damage and loss of customer trust.

### Recommended Remediation
The root cause is the lack of separation between query logic and user-supplied data. To mitigate this, **Parameterized Queries (also known as Prepared Statements)** must be implemented for all database interactions.

#### Insecure Code Example (Conceptual)
```javascript
// User input is directly included in the query string
let userEmail = req.body.email; // e.g., "' OR 1=1--"
let query = "SELECT * FROM Users WHERE email = '" + userEmail + "'";
// The final query becomes: SELECT * FROM Users WHERE email = '' OR 1=1--'
